  • State-of-the-art performance for tabular data
  • Advanced regularization and optimization
  • Excellent handling of mixed data types

4.2 HYPERPARAMETER CONFIGURATION
---------------------------------

Linear Regression:
  • No hyperparameters (baseline implementation)
  • Uses ordinary least squares optimization

Ridge Regression:
  • Alpha (L2 penalty): 1.0
  • Regularization strength balances bias-variance tradeoff

Random Forest:
  • N_estimators: 100 trees
