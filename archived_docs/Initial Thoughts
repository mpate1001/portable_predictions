1. Lets focus on two states or specific regions. Ideally focus on the case study. My suggestions;
    •	Specific ZIP codes, cities, or urban vs. rural contrasts within California.
    •	2–3 representative case study regions (e.g., San Francisco, Fresno, and a rural area) and make it clear you’re comparing them.
Lets focus on comparing urban housing trends in San Francisco with rural areas in inland California to test generalization of our models across socioeconomic and geographic boundaries


2. Synthetic data will need to be generated with known linear and non-linear relationships between features and home prices to benchmark model interpretability and test overfitting behavior.

3. We should review prior work on Zillow housing prediction and recent academic papers on housing price modeling using tree-based methods and SHAP values.

4. Lets test external validity, we could incorporate the King County Housing dataset or compare predicted values against ACS-derived housing cost estimates.
